To run the game simply run main.py, watch out for the necessary requirements!

For testing purposes you may switch some variables in the player_progression.json as a skill like the dash is luck based
or some weapons that take a bit long to get in the monetary system implemeted, otherwise the game would be too easy.

Powerups also spawn randomly so you may alter the spawn rate if you wish in order to evaluate them more easily, to do so is 
very simple in the game.py file altering the value powerupname_spawn_interval to your desired need

If you wish to reset your progress on the options there is a button that does so.
